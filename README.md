# Additional KiCAD Libraries
This is a collection of my own created libraries for [KiCAD](https://kicad-pcb.org/).
Each component is associated with an suitable footprint (3D models left).
If you still need some components, then please refer [some other Third Party Libraries](https://kicad-pcb.org/libraries/third_party) or [generate](http://kicad.rohrbacher.net/quicklib.php) one by yourself.

## Included components
 * __Sensor_Optical-Mouse__
  * PAN3204DB
